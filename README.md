# simple_MVP_snake
Snake written in JavaFX

Experimenting with JavaFX by making a simple game - pretty good overall. It would be sad if this project died.

Run with ./gradlew run or ./gradlew.bat run -> the jvm needs a second or 2 to catch up. You may need Java 11 installed, I'm not sure how gradle works

however I have no idea what the xml file is meant to do and JavaFX 11+ really needs better documentation
